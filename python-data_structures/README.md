## Project Overview

"The Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples" project serves as an introductory exploration of lists and tuples in Python. Its primary objective is to establish a strong foundation for comprehending and utilizing these essential data structures.

The project delves into the usage of lists, including their distinctions and similarities compared to strings. It covers a variety of common list methods and demonstrates how lists can function as stacks and queues. Additionally, the project explores list comprehensions, a powerful technique for creating and manipulating lists.

Furthermore, the project addresses tuples and their application. It provides insights into the appropriate scenarios for using tuples versus lists and introduces key concepts such as sequences, tuple packing, and sequence unpacking. The utilization of the `del` statement is also discussed.
