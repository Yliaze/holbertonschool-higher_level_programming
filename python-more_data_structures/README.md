## Project Overview
The "Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary" project provides an introduction to sets and dictionaries in Python. It explores the features and functionalities of these data structures and highlights their applications in solving various programming problems.

The project covers sets and their usage, including the most common set methods and when to prefer sets over lists. It demonstrates how to iterate over a set and leverage its unique properties for efficient data manipulation.

Additionally, the project delves into dictionaries and their utilization. It explains the concept of keys in dictionaries, demonstrates how to iterate over a dictionary, and discusses the benefits of dictionaries compared to lists or sets.

Furthermore, the project introduces lambda functions, as well as the map, reduce, and filter functions. It illustrates their purpose and showcases how they can be used to simplify code and perform operations on data structures.
