## Project Overview

The "Python - Almost a Circle" project is a comprehensive review of various Python concepts and features. It covers a wide range of topics, including importing modules, handling exceptions, working with classes, private attributes, getter/setter methods, class methods, static methods, inheritance, unittesting, and file input/output operations.

The project also introduces new concepts such as `*args` and `**kwargs`, serialization/deserialization, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and working with named arguments in functions.

The project is divided into several steps, which involve creating classes and implementing different methods and functionalities. You will build classes such as `Base`, `Rectangle`, and `Square` while adding validation, calculation, printing, updating, and conversion capabilities.
