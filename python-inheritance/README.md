## Project Overview

The "Python - Inheritance" project focuses on the concept of inheritance in Python. It explores the relationship between classes, where one class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. By leveraging inheritance, you can create a hierarchy of classes, with subclasses inheriting the characteristics of their superclass or parent class. This project delves into the fundamentals of inheritance, including superclass and subclass relationships, method overriding, multiple inheritance, and the purpose of inheritance in Python.
