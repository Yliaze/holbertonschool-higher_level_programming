## Project Overview

The "Python - Input/Output" project focuses on file input/output operations and working with data in different formats in Python. This project covers various aspects of reading and writing files, including opening and closing files, writing text to a file, reading the full content of a file, reading a file line by line, and manipulating the file cursor. It also introduces the concept of serialization and deserialization using JSON, allowing you to convert Python data structures to JSON strings and vice versa.
